# Eco-round

## Description

Our group as Eco-round are exploring the domain of sexual harassment. We are standing in the victims' perspective and trying to help female victims to cope with the negative effects brought by sexual harassment in entertainment places such as bars and clubs. Based on variety of research including academic papers and reports, interviews and observations, we come up with the idea of "Hug Pillow". And we manage to deploy three prototypes, which are:
1. Implementing heartbeat sensors by using Arduino to illustrate users' emotional statues.
2. Implementing different vibration patterns and pressures according to users' heartbeat by using vibration motors on Arduino.
3. Testing and deciding the physical appearance  of our pillow.
